             Loops
            While condition allows for a loop based on as long as a condition =true it loops.
            while (score !=-1) will loop the statement as long as the 'score' input value isnt -1, and once -1 is put in, the loops breaks.
            X++ will add 1 to X. Y += X is the same as Y = Y + X. 
            while (X != -1) {
                Y++;
            `   Z += X;

                Console.WriteLine(Enter X (-1 ends loop))
                X = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine())
             }
            if (Y > 0)
            Console.WriteLine(((double) Z / Y ));

            this code takes an numerous inputs and averages them.

            int Y = X
            int Z = X 
            ....

            if (Y < X)
                Y = X
            if (Z > X)
                Z = X
            this calculates the minimum and maximum value of X

            '\t' produces a tab  in Console.WriteLine
            
            with loops you need to remember to
            1. define the variables to be used
            2. decide what value will be the conditional value
            3. what needs to be outside the loop
            4. always change the value of the conditional value to avoid infinit loops
            
            you can use an if with a break statement to end a loop

            while (condition1)
                    statement1
                if (condition2) break
                    statement2

            so one can do the following
            while (true){
                read
                if ("break condition") break;
                process
                }
            this allows the read part pf the read-process loop to not need to be called before the loop and therefore is not written twice.
            this can also be used to allow multiple exit conditions, one in the while, and on in the 'if () break'
